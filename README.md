# Outlier Detection in High Dimension with Machine Learning
Summer 2021 Project with Prof Celia Greenwood and Amadou Barry

## GOAL
Apply the REPEN method (a machine learning method for outlier detection) to the ABIDE dataset of neuroimaging data.

## FILE STRUCTURE
- (directory) data: contains the data sets and the lower dimension representation
	
   - (file) abide.csv: must be downloaded separately from http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html
	
   - (file) AID362.csv : can be downloaded from https://github.com/GuansongPang/ADRepository-Anomaly-detection-datasets/blob/main/categorical%20data/AID362red_train_allpossiblenominal.arff
	
   - (file) census.csv: can be downloaded from https://github.com/GuansongPang/ADRepository-Anomaly-detection-datasets/blob/main/numerical%20data/DevNet%20datasets/census-income-full-mixed-binarized.tar.xz
	
   - (subdirectory) representation: contains the lower dimensional representation generated by REPEN

- (directory) logs: where the output and error logs are stored

- (directory) model: where the model checkpoints are saved in .h5 format during the training

- (directory) outlierscores: contains the final outlier scores given by the method after applying random distance-based outlier detection to the lower dimensional representation

- (directory) results: contains some measures of performance and plots
	
   - (file) abide_loss.png: an image of the loss function (same for other datasets)
	
   - (file) AUC_abide.png: an image of the ROC curve with the AUC (same for other datasets)
	
   - (file) auc_performance.csv: contains information about the AUC for different runs
	
   - (file) barplot_scores_abide.png: an plot of the outlier scores with labelled outliers (same for other datasets)

- (file) REPEN.py: contains the main method that implements REPEN, and the main functions involved in the training

- (file) plots_scores.py: contains functions to generate a bar plots of the outlier scores, imported by REPEN.py

- (file) utilities.py: contains helper functions used in REPEN.py

- (file) submit.sh: a submit script for SBATCH that calls REPEN.py
